Taller Trees is a mod, originally by Cyrillya for you to customize the height of the vanilla Terraria trees.
You need to provide enough space for the tree to grow.
You can customize trees' height in Mod Configuration.
Note that palm trees are not included for technical reasons.

If you've downloaded and/or built this - it's not going on workshop as Cyrillya is probably going to update his.
